# Adobe I/O Lib State

A JavaScript abstraction on top of distributed/cloud DBs that exposes a simple state persistence API.

You can initialize the lib with your Adobe I/O Runtime (a.k.a OpenWhisk) credentials.

Alternatively, you can bring your own cloud db keys. As of now we only support Azure Cosmos.

## Install

```bash
npm install @adobe/aio-lib-state
```

## Use

```js
  const stateLib = require('@adobe/aio-lib-state')

  // init
  // init sdk using OpenWhisk credentials
  const state = await stateLib.init({ ow: { namespace, auth } })
  // init when env vars __OW_API_KEY and __OW_NAMESPACE are set (e.g. when running in an OpenWhisk action)
  const state = await stateLib.init()
  // or if you want to use your own cloud DB account
  const state = await stateLib.init({ cosmos: { endpoint, masterKey, databaseId, containerId, partitionKey } })

  // get
  const res = await state.get('key') // res = { value, expiration }
  const value = res.value

  // put
  await state.put('key', 'value')
  await state.put('key', { anObject: 'value' }, { ttl: -1 }) // -1 for no expiry, defaults to 86400 (24 hours)

  // delete
  await state.delete('key')
```

## Adobe I/O State Store Limitations (per user)

Apply when init with OW credentials (and not own cloud DB credentials):

- Max state value size: `2MB`
- Max state key size: `1024 bytes`
- Max total state size: `10 GB`
- Token expiry (need to re-init after expiry): `1 hour`
- Namespace max length: `49 characters`

## Adobe I/O State Store Consistency Guarantees

**Strong consistency** is guaranteed for reads and writes within a single instance of the state sdk (returned by `stateLib.init()`).

However, operations across multiple instances are **eventually consistent**. For example, let's consider two state instances `a` and `b` initialized with the same credentials, then 

```javascript
await a.put('key', 'value')
await b.put('key', 'yolo')
console.log(await a.get('key'))
```

might log either `value` or `yolo` but eventually `a.get('key')` will always return `yolo`. Note that atomicity is ensured, i.e.  `a.get('key')` will never return something like `valyoloue`.


## Troubleshooting

### `"[StateLib:ERROR_INTERNAL] unknown error response from provider with status: unknown"`
- when using `@adobe/aio-lib-state` in an action bundled with **webpack** please make sure to turn off minification and enable resolving of es6 modules. Add the following lines to your webpack config:
```javascript
  optimization: {
    minimize: false
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js'],
    mainFields: ['main']
  }
```
